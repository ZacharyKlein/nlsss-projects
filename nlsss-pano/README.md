# NLSSS Pano

This is a simple web app that functions as a viewer for NLSSS patterns and occurrences. It depends on maps and JSON data generated using the `nlsss-node` application.

## Maps

Maps are stored under the `images/` directory. They are generated using the `nlsss-node/generate-boundary-map` script.

## Chart

The NLSSS chart is populated using data generated by the `nlsss-node/index` script. The file `nlsss.json` must be present for the app to work.

## Usage

Run `npx serve`

Tested with Node.js 18 on MacOS
